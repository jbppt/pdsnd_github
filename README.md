### Date created
Project and README created 7/20/2021.

### Project Title
bikeshare_EDITED.py

### Description
This project was required to pass Udacity's Nanodegree program called Programming for Data Science with Python. I used Python to explore bike share data from New York City, Chicago, and Washington. I scripted code to import data from three csv files and compute descriptive statistics. The script created an interactive experience by asking users how they wished to filter data. Lastly, the script gave an option to view raw code.

### Files used
Below is a list of files used:

bikeshare_EDITED.py

chicago.csv		

new_york_city.csv

washington.csv
